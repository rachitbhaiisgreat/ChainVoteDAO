# ChainVoteDAO

## Project Description
ChainVoteDAO is a simple decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) smart contract built on Ethereum.  
It allows the community to create proposals, vote on them, and execute the most supported ideas transparently on-chain.

## Project Vision
To empower communities with decentralized decision-making, enabling fair and transparent governance without intermediaries.

## Key Features
- üó≥Ô∏è **Proposal Creation:** The DAO owner can create new proposals with descriptions.
- ‚úÖ **Voting System:** Any Ethereum address can vote once per proposal.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Proposal Execution:** Once a proposal gains community support, it can be executed by the owner.
- üîí **On-chain Transparency:** Every action (creation, vote, execution) is logged on the blockchain.

## Future Scope
- Introduce **token-based voting power** instead of equal votes per address.  
- Add **time-based proposal deadlines** to limit voting periods.  
- Implement **multi-owner or delegated governance**.  
- Create a **frontend DApp** for real-time proposal tracking and voting using Web3.js or Ethers.js.  
- Integrate **automated proposal execution** via smart contracts.
